## Количественные формулы. Домашнее задание

1. Suppose that we want to enhance the processor used for web serving. The new
processor is 10 times faster on computation in the web serving application than
the old processor. Assuming that the original processor is busy with computation
40% of the time and is waiting for I/O 60% of the time, what is the overall speedup
gained by incorporating the enhancement?
